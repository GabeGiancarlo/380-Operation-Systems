ABSTRACT
This study examined emotional responses to video stimuli across three conditions
(Control: Time Management, Soldier: Homecoming, Sports: Olympic Hockey) and explored
whether international student status moderated these responses. A sample of 28 participants
(Mage = 24.86 years, SD = 14.49) completed an online survey in which they viewed three videos
in counterbalanced order (with Control always presented first) and rated their emotional
responses using 7-point Likert scales. Results from repeated measures ANOVA revealed a
significant main effect of condition on negative emotions, F(2, 54) = 50.745, p < .001, η²p =
.454, with both Soldier and Sports conditions eliciting higher negative emotions than the Control
condition. No significant differences were found for positive emotions across conditions. Mixed
ANOVA revealed no significant moderation by international student status, though a marginally
significant interaction emerged for negative emotions (p = .071). These findings demonstrate that
emotionally charged video content reliably elicits negative emotional responses, though the role
of cultural factors requires further investigation with larger samples and direct measurement of
cultural dimensions. The study establishes proof-of-concept for examining cultural moderation
of media-elicited emotions and provides effect size estimates for future power analyses.

Cross-Cultural Emotional Responses to Video Media:
International Student Status as a Moderator

Social media has rapidly transformed from a space for self-expression to a global arena
where users collectively experience, interpret, and emotionally respond to world events.
Platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Meta (formerly Facebook and Instagram), and YouTube
now serve as primary mediators of emotional discourse surrounding humanitarian crises,
international sports, and cultural moments. Their design—centered on algorithmic curation and
participatory engagement—amplifies emotionally charged content, promoting cross-border
emotional alignment among diverse audiences (Yolanda et al., 2025). As individuals across
different nations increasingly consume the same global media, the emotional responses once
bound by local culture have begun to converge, forming new, transnational affective
communities.
Foundational theories in cross-cultural psychology provide essential frameworks for
understanding how culture shapes emotional experiences. Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory
identifies six key dimensions that influence behavior, communication, and psychological
processes across cultures (Hofstede, 2001; Hofstede et al., 2010). The individualism-collectivism
dimension is particularly relevant for understanding emotional responses: individualistic cultures
emphasize personal achievement, independence, and direct emotional expression, while
collectivistic cultures prioritize group harmony, interdependence, and context-dependent

4

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
emotional expression. Similarly, Uses and Gratifications theory proposes that individuals
actively select media to satisfy specific psychological and social needs (Katz et al., 1973;
Ruggiero, 2000). This framework suggests that cultural differences in media gratifications may
influence how individuals respond emotionally to media content, as people from different
cultural backgrounds may use media differently to satisfy emotional and social needs.
Cross-cultural emotion research establishes that while basic emotions may be universal,
their expression, experience, and regulation vary significantly across cultures. Mesquita and
Frijda (1992) identified key cultural differences in emotion elicitation, expression, experience,
and regulation. For example, collectivistic cultures may suppress individual emotions to maintain
group harmony, while individualistic cultures encourage direct emotional expression. Tsai's
(2007) ideal affect theory proposes that cultures differ in the emotions they value and want to
feel: European Americans value high-arousal positive emotions (excitement, enthusiasm), while
East Asians value low-arousal positive emotions (calm, peacefulness). Markus and Kitayama
(1991) demonstrated that self-construal shapes emotion: independent selves experience emotions
as internal, personal states, while interdependent selves experience emotions as relational,
context-dependent states. Kitayama and colleagues (2000) further showed that the relationship
between emotions and well-being differs across cultures, with individualistic cultures strongly
associating positive emotions with well-being, while collectivistic cultures link well-being to
emotional balance and social role fulfillment.
Media effects research provides mechanisms through which media content elicits
emotions. Zillmann's (1988) mood management theory proposes that individuals select media
content to regulate their emotional states, seeking to maximize positive moods and minimize

5

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
negative ones. Nabi (2009) outlined key mechanisms through which media content elicits
emotions: direct emotional responses to content features, cognitive appraisal processes, empathy
and identification with characters, and mood contagion. Oliver and Raney (2011) distinguished
between hedonic (pleasure-seeking) and eudaimonic (meaning-seeking) motivations for media
consumption, noting that the same content may elicit different emotional reactions depending on
whether individuals approach it with hedonic or eudaimonic motivations.
Research on meaningful media content demonstrates that when content is perceived as
meaningful, audiences experience more complex emotional responses, including both negative
and positive emotions (Bartsch & Mares, 2014; Rieger & Klimmt, 2019). Recent research on
social media and cultural identity provides the most direct foundation for the current study.
Cross-cultural differences in social media adoption reveal that individualistic cultures tend to
find social media more useful and use platforms for self -promotion and personal documentation,
while collectivistic cultures emphasize social interaction and networking (Alsaleh et al., 2019;
Deng et al., 2024; Sheldon et al., 2017). For international students specifically, social media
contact with different groups (co-nationals, host-country nationals, other international students)
has differential effects on cultural adaptation and psychological well-being (Gaitán-Aguilar et
al., 2022). Social media platforms serve as important spaces for identity work, particularly for
marginalized, diasporic, and immigrant groups, who create hybrid identities that blend multiple
cultural elements (Koutrouba & Georgalou, 2025; Perera et al., 2021). These platforms enable
users to express cultural identity in ways that reflect both their heritage and their current cultural
context.

6

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
Despite extensive research on cross-cultural emotion, media effects, and social media
use, limited research has examined how international student status moderates emotional
responses to video stimuli. This gap is particularly significant given that international students
represent a unique population at the intersection of multiple cultural contexts: they maintain
connections to their heritage culture while navigating a new cultural environment, potentially
experiencing emotions differently than domestic students when consuming media content. The
present study addresses this gap by examining emotional responses to video content across three
conditions (Control: Time Management, Soldier: Homecoming, Sports: Olympic Hockey) with
international student status as a potential moderator. Drawing from prior research that links
cultural background to emotion experience and regulation (Mesquita & Frijda, 1992; Nabi, 2009;
Gaitán-Aguilar et al., 2022), this design seeks to operationalize emotion as both an outcome of
media engagement and a potential indicator of cultural differences in emotional processing. We
hypothesize that video condition will significantly affect emotional responses, with emotionally
charged content (Soldier and Sports conditions) eliciting stronger emotional responses than
neutral content (Control condition). Additionally, we explore whether international student status
moderates these effects, given that international students may have different emotion norms,
ideal affect, and self-construals than domestic students. This investigation contributes to
understanding how cultural identity—operationalized through international student status serves
as a boundary condition for media-elicited emotional responses, with implications for crosscultural communication, media design, and support services for diverse student populations.

Method

Participants and Recruitment
Participants were recruited using a snowball sampling method, which involved initial
recruitment through multiple channels followed by participant referrals. This approach was
selected to reach diverse populations, including international students who may be less
accessible through traditional university recruitment methods. Recruitment was conducted
through several channels to maximize sample diversity and reach.
Primary recruitment occurred through social media platforms. Study information and
survey links were posted on Meta (Instagram and Facebook), X (formerly Twitter), and
YouTube. Posts included brief descriptions of the study, eligibility criteria (18 years or older,
ability to view videos in English), and links to the online survey. Additionally, recruitment
materials were shared in online communities including Discord servers and Slack channels
frequented by students and researchers. Physical recruitment was conducted through posters
displayed on the Chapman University campus. These posters included QR codes that participants
could scan with their mobile devices to access the survey directly, reducing barriers to
participation.
It is important to note that the university's Institutional Review Board reviewed the study
materials and deemed certain types of content inappropriate for use in research. The research
team complied with these restrictions and selected video stimuli that met university guidelines

8

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
while still allowing for meaningful examination of emotional responses. All video content was
reviewed and approved prior to data collection.
Eligibility criteria required participants to be at least 18 years old and provide informed
consent. A total of n = 28 participants completed the study. The sample had a mean age of M =
24.86 years (SD = 14.49), with a range from 18 to 86 years. Regarding gender, 14 participants
(50.0%) identified as male, 12 participants (42.9%) identified as female, and 2 participants
(7.1%) identified as other or non-binary. The sample showed diversity in ethnic representation,
with the largest group being White (n = 13, 46.4%), followed by Pacific Islander (n = 4, 14.3%),
and various multiracial and other ethnic combinations. Multiple participants selected more than
one ethnicity category, reflecting the multiracial nature of the sample. Regarding international
student status, 18 participants (64.3%) identified as domestic students, 7 participants (25.0%)
identified as international students, and 3 participants (10.7%) preferred not to say. The sample
demonstrated considerable diversity in cultural identity, with 28 unique responses ranging from
national identities (e.g., "American," "Filipino," "Greek") to regional identities (e.g.,
"Californian," "Hawaiian") to ideological identities (e.g., "Liberal," "Swedish Left").

Left").

Design
The study employed a mixed factorial design with one within-subjects factor and one
between- subjects factor. The within-subjects factor was Video Condition with three levels:
Control (Time Management video), Soldier (Homecoming video), and Sports (Olympic Hockey
video). The between-subjects factor was International Student Status with three levels: Yes, No,
and Prefer not to say. This design maximizes statistical power by controlling for individual
differences and allows for direct within-participant comparisons across conditions (Maxwell &
Delaney, 2004; Field, 2018).
The survey structure was designed to ensure participants were actively engaged with the
video content and to verify attention throughout the study. After viewing each video, participants
first completed a content check by providing a free-response text description of what they saw in
the video. This content check served multiple purposes: (1) to verify that participants were
actually watching and processing the video content rather than multitasking or skipping videos,
(2) to assess comprehension and engagement with the material, and (3) to provide a qualitative
measure of how participants interpreted the content. Following the content check, participants

10

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
completed emotion ratings using Likert scales. This sequence—video viewing, content check,
then emotion ratings—was designed to ensure that emotional responses were based on actual
engagement with the content rather than superficial viewing.
Video presentation order was structured to establish a neutral baseline before exposing
participants to emotionally charged content. The Control condition (Time Management video)
was always presented first to all participants, serving as a baseline measure of emotional state
before exposure to potentially emotionally evocative content. This approach was selected to
minimize carryover effects from emotionally charged videos affecting responses to the neutral
control condition. After the Control condition, the two experimental conditions (Soldier and
Sports) were presented in randomized order, with each participant receiving one of two possible
orders (Soldier-Sports or Sports-Soldier). This partial counterbalancing approach controlled for
order effects while maintaining the baseline function of the Control condition.

Materials
Video Stimuli. Three video stimuli were used in the study, all sourced from YouTube to
ensure ecological validity and representativeness of content that participants might encounter in
naturalistic settings. Each video was selected to represent different emotional profiles and
cultural relevance.
The Control condition featured a time management educational video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUO8Qvcs7cY). This video presented whiteboard drawings
with narration explaining study habits and time management strategies. The content was
deliberately neutral in emotional tone, focusing on educational information without emotional
appeals, dramatic elements, or culturally specific references. This video was selected as a

11

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
baseline condition because it was designed to be informative rather than emotionally evocative,
allowing for comparison with emotionally charged content. The educational nature of the content
also ensured that it would be appropriate for a university setting and unlikely to elicit strong
emotional responses that could confound comparisons with experimental conditions.
The Soldier condition featured a video of a military service member returning home and
surprising his father (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoV4TWiXI0k). This video depicted
an emotional reunion moment in which a service member arrives at his father's workplace and
surprises him, resulting in an emotional embrace. The video was selected because it contains
clear emotional content (joy, relief, family connection) that is likely to resonate across cultural
boundaries while potentially eliciting different emotional responses based on cultural
background. The theme of family reunion and military service has both universal elements
(family bonds, separation and return) and culturally specific associations (military service,
patriotism) that may vary in relevance for international versus domestic students.
The Sports condition featured a video of the 1980 Olympic hockey game between the
United States and the Soviet Union (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htHOEYgFXGU

12

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES

), specifically showing the final moments of the game and the celebration following the
U.S. victory. This video was selected because it represents a historically significant moment in
American sports culture—the "Miracle on Ice"—that may have different emotional resonance for
participants based on their cultural background and familiarity with American sports history. The
video contains elements of tension (close game), triumph (victory celebration), and
historical/cultural significance that may be more meaningful to participants with greater
familiarity with American culture and sports history. For international students, this content may
elicit different emotional responses depending on their knowledge of the historical context,
identification with American culture, or lack thereof.

13

Emotion Measures
Emotional responses were measured using a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (Not at
all) to 7 (An extreme amount). The 7-point scale was selected over the more common 5-point
scale for several theoretical and methodological reasons. First, 7-point scales provide greater
sensitivity and discrimination ability, allowing for more nuanced assessment of emotional
intensity (Dawes, 2008). Second, 7-point scales are standard in emotion research, as evidenced
by their use in validated measures such as the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS;
Watson et al., 1988) and the Self-Assessment Manikin (Bradley & Lang, 1994). Third, the
additional response options better capture subtle differences in emotional responses that may be
particularly important when examining cross-cultural differences, where emotional intensity may
vary in ways that a 5-point scale might not detect. Finally, 7-point scales provide a neutral
midpoint (4) while still offering sufficient range above and below to capture variation in
emotional responses.
Positive emotions were assessed using five specific emotion items: interested, hopeful,
inspired, grateful, and joyful. These emotions were selected to capture both high-arousal positive
states (interested, inspired, joyful) and lower-arousal positive states (hopeful, grateful),
consistent with the circumplex model of affect (Russell, 1980). This selection also aligns with
research on meaningful media content, which suggests that eudaimonic media experiences often
elicit emotions such as inspiration and gratitude (Oliver & Raney, 2011; Rieger & Klimmt,
2019). The inclusion of "interested" captures engagement and attention, while "hopeful,"
"inspired," "grateful," and "joyful" represent distinct positive emotional experiences that may be
differentially elicited by different types of content.

14

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
Negative emotions were assessed using five specific emotion items: sad, angry, anxious,
guilty, and upset. These emotions were selected to represent different dimensions of negative
affect: sadness (low-arousal negative), anger and anxiety (high-arousal negative), guilt (selfconscious negative emotion), and upset (general negative distress). This selection provides
comprehensive coverage of negative emotional experiences while avoiding redundancy. The
inclusion of both high-arousal (angry, anxious) and low-arousal (sad) negative emotions allows
for examination of how different types of content elicit different patterns of negative affect,
consistent with the circumplex model (Russell, 1980).
After each video, participants first completed a content check (free-response text
description), then rated their emotional responses using the Likert scales. For each emotion,
participants indicated how much they felt that emotion "right now" on a scale from 1 (Not at all)
to 7 (An extreme amount). The exact wording and format of the emotion scales are shown in
Figure 2. Items were averaged to create mean positive and negative emotion scores for each
condition, providing a more reliable measure than individual items and controlling for individual
differences in response tendencies (Watson et al., 1988; Russell, 1980; Bradle & Lang, 1994).

emotion (sad, angry, anxious, guilty, upset) on a 7-point scale from 1 (Not at all) to 7 (An extreme

Demographic Measures
Participants provided demographic information including age (continuous variable),
gender (categorical: male, female, other/non-binary), ethnicity (categorical with multiple
selections allowed: White, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander,
Native American, Middle Eastern, Multiracial), international student status (categorical: Yes,
No, Prefer not to say), and cultural identity (open-ended text response).

Procedure
Participants accessed the study through an online survey platform (Qualtrics). Upon
accessing the survey, participants were first presented with an informed consent form that
explained the study purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits, and their rights as

16

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
participants. Participants were required to indicate that they were at least 18 years old and
provide electronic consent before proceeding. Those who did not meet the age requirement or
declined consent were automatically excluded from the study.
After providing consent, participants completed a pre-survey assessing their current
mood and emotional state. This baseline measure was included to account for participants'
emotional state prior to video exposure, allowing for examination of changes in emotional
responses relative to baseline.
Participants then viewed three videos in a structured order. The Control condition (Time
Management video) was always presented first to establish a neutral emotional baseline. This
was followed by the two experimental conditions (Soldier and Sports) in randomized order. The
randomization was implemented at the survey level, with each participant automatically assigned
to one of two possible orders: (1) Control → Soldier → Sports, or (2) Control → Sports →
Soldier. This partial counterbalancing approach ensured that order effects for the experimental
conditions were controlled while maintaining the baseline function of the Control condition.
After viewing each video, participants completed two assessment tasks in sequence. First,
participants completed a content check by providing a free-response text description of what they
saw in the video. This open-ended question asked participants to describe the video content in
their own words, serving as both an attention check and a measure of content comprehension.
Participants were required to provide a response before proceeding to the next section. Second,
participants completed emotion ratings using the 7-point Likert scales described above. For each
video, participants rated all five positive emotions (interested, hopeful, inspired, grateful, joyful)
and all five negative emotions (sad, angry, anxious, guilty, upset). The emotion scales were

17

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
presented with positive emotions first, followed by negative emotions, with the order of
individual emotion items randomized within each category to control for order effects.
After viewing all three videos and completing all emotion ratings, participants completed
a post-survey assessing their mood and emotional state. This post-survey was identical to the
pre- survey and allowed for examination of overall changes in emotional state following
exposure to all video content.
Finally, participants completed demographic questions including age, gender, ethnicity,
international student status, religion, and cultural identity. The cultural identity question was
open-ended, allowing participants to describe their cultural identity in their own words rather
than forcing them into predefined categories.
Upon completion of all measures, participants were presented with a debriefing statement
that explained the study purpose, hypotheses, and the rationale for the video selection.
Participants were thanked for their time and provided with contact information for the
researchers should they have questions or concerns. The entire procedure took approximately 15
- 20 minutes to complete.

Results
Descriptive statistics for emotion scores across conditions are presented below. For
positive emotions, mean scores were M = 3.66 (SD = 1.55) for the Control condition, M = 3.58
(SD = 1.80) for the Soldier condition, and M = 3.64 (SD = 1.86) for the Sports condition. For
negative emotions, mean scores were M = 1.00 (SE = 0.05) for the Control condition, M = 2.00
(SE = 0.10) for the Soldier condition, and M = 1.60 (SE = 0.08) for the Sports condition.

18

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to examine the effect of video condition on
positive emotion scores. Results showed no significant effect of condition on positive emotions,
F(2, 54) < 1, p = .953, η²p = .000 (see Figure 1). This indicates that positive emotional responses
did not differ significantly across the three video conditions.

conditions (Control: Time Management, Soldier: Homecoming, Sports: Olympic Hockey) in a

A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to examine the effect of video condition on
negative emotion scores. Results showed a significant main effect of condition on negative
emotions, F(2, 54) = 50.75, p < .001, η²p = .454 (see Figure 2). This indicates a large effect size,
with negative emotional responses varying significantly across conditions. Tukey post-hoc tests
with Bonferroni correction revealed significant differences between the Control condition (M =

Control condition and the Sports condition (M = 1.60, SE = 0.08), p < .001. However, there was
no significant difference between the Soldier and Sports conditions, p = .717.

A mixed ANOVA was conducted to examine the interaction between video condition and
international student status. For positive emotions, results revealed no significant main effect of

Discussion
The present pilot study examined emotional responses to video stimuli across three
conditions and explored whether international student status moderated these responses. This
investigation serves as a proof-of-concept study that establishes methodological feasibility and
provides effect size estimates for future power analyses. Results revealed that negative emotions
varied significantly across conditions, with both the Soldier and Sports conditions eliciting
higher negative emotions than the Control condition, demonstrating a large effect size (η²p =
.454). However, positive emotions did not differ significantly across conditions, with all
conditions producing similar mean scores near the midpoint of the scale (M = 3.58-3.66).

22

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
International student status did not significantly moderate the effects of condition on positive
emotions, and while there was a marginally significant interaction for negative emotions (p =
.071, η²p = .156), the effect did not reach conventional significance levels, likely due to
insufficient statistical power given the small sample size.
The finding that negative emotions varied significantly across conditions aligns with
research on emotion elicitation through media content. Nabi (2009) outlined mechanisms
through which media content elicits emotions, including cognitive appraisal processes and
empathy with characters. The Soldier condition, featuring an emotional reunion between a
service member and his father, likely elicited negative emotions through empathy and
identification with theemotional moment. Similarly, the Sports condition, featuring a tense
hockey game with historical significance, may have elicited negative emotions through the
tension and uncertainty of the game's outcome. Zillmann's (1988) mood management theory
suggests that individuals select media to regulate emotions, but in experimental contexts where
content is controlled, the emotional content itself drives responses. Bartsch and Mares (2014)
demonstrated that meaningful media content can elicit complex emotional responses, including
both negative and positive emotions, which may explain why emotionally charged content
(Soldier and Sports) elicited stronger negative emotional responses than the neutral Control
condition.
The non-significant finding for positive emotions may reflect several factors. First, the
content characteristics of the videos may have been more effective at eliciting negative emotions
(through empathy, tension, or concern) than positive emotions. The Control condition while
educational and potentially positive, may not have been designed to elicit strong positive

23

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
emotions. The Soldier condition, despite featuring a joyful reunion, may have also elicited
concern or sadness alongside positive emotions, resulting in mixed emotional responses. Oliver
and Raney's (2011) distinction between hedonic and eudaimonic motivations suggests that
individuals may approach media content with different goals, and the same content may elicit
different emotional reactions depending on these motivations. The videos used in this study may
have been more aligned with eudaimonic motivations (seeking meaning, inspiration) than
hedonic motivations (seeking pleasure), which could explain the stronger negative emotional
responses relative to positive emotional responses.
The finding that international student status did not significantly moderate emotional
responses warrants careful interpretation. While cultural differences in emotion experience,
expression, and regulation are well-established (Mesquita & Frijda, 1992; Gaitán-Aguilar et al.,
2022), the current pilot study's sample size (n = 28) severely limited statistical power to detect
interaction effects. With only 7 international students, 18 domestic students, and 3 participants
who preferred not to say, the study was underpowered to detect anything but very large
interaction effects. Post-hoc power analysis indicates that the study had approximately 30%
power to detect a medium-sized interaction effect (f = 0.25), well below the recommended 80%
threshold. Additionally, the sample demonstrated considerable diversity in cultural identity, with
28 unique responses among 28 participants, suggesting that international student status is a crude
proxy that may not capture the full range of cultural differences present in the sample. The
marginally significant interaction for negative emotions (p = .071, η²p = .156) represents a
medium-to-large effect size and suggests that there may be meaningful differences that would
reach significance with adequate statistical power. This pattern, combined with the large main

24

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
effect for negative emotions, provides preliminary evidence that cultural factors may indeed
moderate emotional responses, though definitive conclusions require replication with larger
Samples.
These findings have important implications for understanding how media content elicits
emotions and how cultural factors may influence these responses, though the pilot nature of this
study requires that implications be interpreted cautiously. The results demonstrate that
emotionally charged video content can reliably elicit negative emotional responses with large
effect sizes, which has applications for media producers, educators, and mental health
professionals. For educators, understanding how different types of content affect emotional
responses can inform the selection of educational materials and the design of learning
experiences, particularly when working with diverse student populations. For media producers,
these findings highlight the importance of content characteristics in shaping emotional response
and suggest that emotional content may have differential effects across cultural groups. For
mental health professionals, understanding how media content affects emotions can inform
interventions and support for individuals who may be particularly sensitive to emotional content,
with particular relevance for international students navigating cultural transitions.
However, the current study's limitations necessitate that these implications be considered
preliminary. The small sample size, limited diversity, and reliance on international student status
as a proxy for culture mean that definitive conclusions about cultural moderation cannot be
drawn. Rather, this pilot study establishes proof-of-concept for the methodological approach and
provides effect size estimates that can inform power analyses for future research. The large main
effect for negative emotions (η²p = .454) and the medium-sized interaction effect for negative

25

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
emotions (η²p = .156) suggest that both the manipulation and the potential moderation effect are
substantial enough to warrant further investigation with adequate statistical power.
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting these findings, and this study
should be understood as a pilot investigation that establishes proof-of-concept for examining
cultural moderation of media-elicited emotions. First, the sample size (n = 28) limits statistical
power, particularly for detecting interaction effects. With only 7-18 participants per international
student status group, the study was underpowered to detect medium-sized interaction effects.
Power analysis indicates that a sample of approximately 150-200 participants would be needed
to achieve adequate power (0.80) to detect medium-sized interaction effects. Second, the sample
showed limited diversity in some categories and was primarily recruited from Chapman
University, which may limit generalizability to broader populations. Third, emotional responses
were measured using self-report Likert scales, which may be subject to social desirability bias or
cultural differences in response styles. Fourth, the specific video content used may limit
generalizability to other types of media content, particularly shorter-form content that is more
representative of contemporary social media. Finally, the study used an online survey format,
which, while increasing accessibility, may not fully capture the immersive experience of viewing
videos in naturalistic settings.
Additionally, the current study measured emotional responses but did not assess whether
these responses translate into meaningful real-world outcomes. Understanding whether mediaelicited emotions lead to behavioral intentions, attitude changes, or actual behaviors is critical for
understanding the broader implications of emotional responses to media content. Future research
should examine whether emotional responses predict intentions to share content, engage in

26

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
related behaviors, or take action on issues depicted in media. This would move beyond
measuring transient emotional states to understanding how media-elicited emotions connect to
measurable real-world effects.
Future research should address the limitations identified above through several
methodological and conceptual improvements. First, sample size and recruitment: A larger,
more diverse sample is essential for detecting interaction effects and improving generalizability.
Future studies should aim for n = 200-250 participants, with balanced representation across
international and domestic student groups. Recruitment should extend beyond a single university
to include participants from multiple institutions and geographic locations, including
international participants from various countries. This would allow for more robust examination
of cultural differences and reduce the influence of institution-specific factors.
Second, video format and length: The current study used longer-form videos (several
minutes in length), which may not reflect the contemporary media landscape dominated by shortform content. Future research should examine emotional responses to shorter videos (8-15
seconds), which are more representative of platforms like TikTok, Meta Reels (formerly
Instagram Reels), and YouTube Shorts. Shorter videos may reduce participant burden,
potentially increasing completion rates and engagement, while also providing more meaningful
responses as participants are less likely to experience fatigue or disengagement. Additionally,
shorter videos allow for examination of a greater number of stimuli within the same time frame,
increasing statistical power and generalizability.
Third, attention check methodology: The current study used free-response text
descriptions as content checks, which require manual coding and analysis. Future research

27

VIDEO MEDIA AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
should consider simplified attention checks that are more efficient and objective. One promising
approach is to replace the text-based content check with a Likert scale item asking participants to
"select neutral" or respond to a specific question about video content using a Likert scale. This
would eliminate the need for text analysis while still verifying attention, and could be easily
automated for data processing. Such an approach would also reduce participant burden and
potentially increase data quality by making attention checks less intrusive.
Fourth, measurement of action and behavioral outcomes: As noted above, future
research should move beyond measuring emotional responses to examining whether these
responses translate into meaningful outcomes. This could include measures of behavioral
intentions (e.g., "How likely are you to share this video?"), actual behaviors (e.g., tracking
whether participants share content or engage with related materials), or attitude changes (e.g.,
pre-post measures of attitudes toward issues depicted in videos). Understanding the connection
between emotional responses and real-world actions is critical for understanding the broader
implications of media-elicited emotions, particularly in contexts where media content is intended
to inspire action or change.
Fifth, direct measurement of cultural dimensions: Rather than relying solely on
international student status as a proxy for cultural differences, future research should include
direct measurement of cultural dimensions such as individualism-collectivism (Triandis &
Gelfand, 1998), self-construal (Singelis, 1994), ideal affect (Tsai, 2007), and acculturation
strategies. This would provide more precise understanding of how specific cultural factors
moderate emotional responses, moving beyond the crude categorization of international versus

28

domestic students to examine continuous cultural variables that may better capture the
heterogeneity observed in the current sample.
Sixth, multimethod assessment: Combining self-report measures with physiological
measures (e.g., heart rate variability, skin conductance) and behavioral measures (e.g., facial
expression coding) would provide more comprehensive assessment of emotional responses. This
would address concerns about self-report bias and cultural differences in response styles, while
also providing convergent validity for emotional responses. Additionally, including continuous
emotion tracking during video viewing (rather than only post-viewing ratings) would provide
insights into the temporal dynamics of emotional responses.
Finally, culturally tailored stimuli: Future research should include video stimuli that are
specifically designed to vary in cultural relevance, allowing for more precise examination of how
cultural background influences emotional responses. This could include videos with varying
levels of cultural specificity (universal content, Western-specific content, Eastern-specific
content, participant's heritage culture-specific content), enabling direct tests of cultural
moderation hypotheses.
